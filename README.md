## Introduction

This repository includes my notes, code snippets, and projects from the Python AI course. It's organized by week and covers various topics in AI using Python.

## Course Outline

1. **Week 1:** Introduction to Python and Basic Syntax
2. **Week 2:** Data Structures and Algorithms
3. **Week 3:** Introduction to Machine Learning
4. **Week 4:** Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Additionally, it's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
